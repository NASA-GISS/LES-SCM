# LES-SCM
Library of large-eddy simulation (LES) and single-column model (SCM) case studies are used for climate model column physics development and testing at NASA GISS. The first priority of this repository is to publicly share ModelE SCM run decks, SCM outputs, and LES outputs used as SCM benchmarks.


```{attention}
If you are interested in running LES/SCM cases using your native LES and/or SCM code, then please contact us.
```


> [!IMPORTANT]
> LES and SCM output will soon be provided through the [NASA Discovery Datashare Portal](https://portal.nccs.nasa.gov/datashare/giss-les-scm/)
